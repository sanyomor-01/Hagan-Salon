# Hagan Salon Website

A responsive salon website I designed and built as part of my journey in the 100Devs software engineering bootcamp.  
The project was created from scratch to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while focusing on clean UI and responsive design.  
It showcases salon services, pricing, and a booking/contact section, making it a great portfolio piece to demonstrate both coding and design skills.

## Overview

This project is a fully responsive salon website built to practice and showcase modern web development skills.  
The goal was to design and implement a clean, user-friendly interface that highlights salon services, pricing, and booking options.

The site adapts across devices using CSS Flexbox, Grid, and media queries, ensuring a seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile.  
It was also a great opportunity to strengthen my JavaScript skills by adding interactivity and improving the overall user experience.

By combining both design and development, this project reflects my ability to take an idea from concept to execution â€” from creating the UI design to coding the final product.
